title: OKD ( openshift origin ) on raspberry pi

For a recent client we have been looking to move most of our stuff into some for of cloud.
and they decided to use openshift, so to get more familiar with it i thought i would set it up
on my raspberry pi at home just to play around with the core concepts.

Turns out that is more troublesome than i thought.

## What is OKD ?

OKD ( formerly known as openshift origin ) is the open-source community edition of Redhats Openshift software.
its basically kubernetes with some niceties on top.

So what is the problem ?
well, there are releases to download from their [git](https://github.com/openshift/origin), but the builds are only
for Linux(amd64), windows and macOS, to be able to run it on the raspberry pi we need to build it for the arm architecture.
Doing that on the rpi(raspberry pi) is not ideal, so how do we build it ? well.. docker to the rescue.

## Lets get started

first, we need to build the [OKD](https://github.com/openshift/origin) binaries for arm.
To do this, we will create our first Dockerfile.

```Dockerfile
FROM centos:8
// Set environment variables to enable arm build
ENV OKD_VERSION v3.11.0
ENV CGO_ENABLED=0
ENV GOOS=linux
ENV GOARCH=arm64
ENV GOARM=7
// install golang
RUN yum -y update\
    yum module -y install go-toolset
RUN mkdir -p $HOME/go/src/github.com/

RUN go build -v -tags 'include_gcs include_oss containers_image_openpgp' github.com/openshift/origin/cmd/oc

```
