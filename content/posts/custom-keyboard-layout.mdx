So i have for a long time used third party software to rebind my keyboard so that I could
use the US keyboard layout when i program and still use åäö which are used quite a lot in swedish.
and i didn't want to switch keyboard layout just to type those letters.

I started with karabiner, but then the software stoped working with a macOS update.
so then i used BetterTouchTool to rebind the left option key on my macbook and corresponding key to **insert** the
correct character. but its not optimal to rely on a not free third party app, so I
decided to build real alternative keyboard layout that functions in the way that i wanted to.

## macOS

I used [ukulele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/) to modify the US layout to add the `option+[` becomes å and so on

## Windows

I used **Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator** and did the same thing but with `altgr+[` to åäö

## Linux

didn't need to do anything since gnome had a prebuilt keyboard that had exactly what i was looking for.

I uploaded both the mac and the windows keyboard layouts [here](https://github.com/jb-san/Swemarican/releases/tag/1.0.0)
